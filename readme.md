# Computer Vision with OpenCV #
## This project is divided into two parts: ##

1. Character recognition using MNIST to process images and video stream

Character detection is implemented with OpenCV to preprocess ROI (region of interest), and the recognition part uses trained MNIST model to identify characters.

2. YOLO system object detection using COCO dataset and self-trained modoel for video stream processing
